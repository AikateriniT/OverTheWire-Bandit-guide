OverTheWire: Bandit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 0 -> 1

For the first level I worked with Putty SSH. Host name was bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. Use as u: bandit0 and p:bandit0. Hint: When we write the password for the server it never shows. To get the password for the level 1 :
  
  ls -la (list  -list all)
  To get the names of all the files in the directory listed.
  
In order to read the readme file:

  cat readme 
  And it writes the password written in the file readme.
